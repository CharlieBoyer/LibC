## Personal Library for C language

**Welcome !** \
As part of my IT studies, this is my personal library, build through my first year while I learn the C language.

This lib containes some sub-libraries that used for specific projects other are more generical and serve as tools. \
Here are all available libraries :

> Note : Some libraries are incomplete or still in progress

## Available Libraries

+ **my_printf.a** :

  This library was build for a project where we must reprogram *printf* ***libC*** function

+ **tools.a** :

  Build through the projects, this one contains all tools function. Some are remakes of **libC functions**, other are remakes again but from **system calls**, and finally there are created functions useful for various task such as an easier ***memory allocation***, ***data management***, etc...

+ **graphical.a** :

  Always in C language, we had to do some "graphical projects" such as video games.
  With the help of the external ***CSFML library***, an adaptation of _**SFML** lib for C language_, this library contains useful functions for ***initialize windows***, ***graphical elements***, ***events***, ***loop control***, ***memory*** and ***performances managemement***.

  > Note : Although it still in progress, there are lot of generical function waiting to be added.

+ **linked_list.a** :

  Mandatory for some projects, useful in every other case, building this one help us to understand linked_list concept as well as memory acces speed. The goal was to create, manage and recover ressources more easily.
  
  > Note : Still in progress !

+ **file_system.a** :

  For this one, I wanted to make opening, reading, and file writting and management in general, more easier for a lot of projects, including creating Shell (Command Interpreter), as well for a lot of configuration files.

+ **algo.a** :

  I'm sorry, there almost nothing here. Basically, some algorythms for sorting, making things recursively are useful. I wanted to add "generical" functions for reproducing a "bubble_sort" like, a basic algorythm for sorting growing numbers.
